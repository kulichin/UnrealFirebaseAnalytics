# Firebase Analytics
Firebase Analytics plugin for Unreal Engine which provides various methods for logging a user actions. Currently plugin support only **Android** platform.

Firebase Analytics helps you understand how people use your Android app. The SDK automatically captures a number of events and user properties and also allows you to define your own custom events to measure the things that uniquely matter to your business. Once the data is captured, it's available in a dashboard through the Firebase console. This dashboard provides detailed insights about your data â€” from summary data such as active users and demographics, to more detailed data such as identifying your most purchased items.

Analytics also integrates with a number of other Firebase features. For example, it automatically logs events that correspond to notification messages sent via the Notifications composer and provides reporting on the impact of each campaign.
